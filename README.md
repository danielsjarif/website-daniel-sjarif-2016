Website project to test our HTML5 and CSS3

###3/25/2016
````
- index.html is the homepage for my supposed website, so far the information on the front page is still pretty bare, but the template for the whole website is pretty much done.
- Will add a slider for the first four images
- Other pages will include 'about.html', 'boats.html', and 'leveling.html'
- Leveling tips will include 2 more subsections which will be implemented under a drop down menu when you hover over the tab.
- All written content is subject to change!!!!
