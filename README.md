Website project to test our HTML5 and CSS3

- index.html is the homepage for my supposed website, so far the information on the front page is still pretty bare, but the template for the whole website is pretty much done.
- Will add a slider for the first four images
- Other pages will include 'about.html', 'boats.html', and 'leveling.html'
- Leveling tips will include 2 more subsections which will be implemented under a drop down menu when you hover over the tab.
- All written content is subject to change!!!!

- Added boats.html, about.html, and levelling.html
- No content yet, basically just templates.

- Connected the subsections to each other, so clicking on them would take you to the selected page. Still nothing on them
- Made a dropdown feature for levelling tips
- Changed the picture URLs so that they actually come from my computer
- uploaded a new folder called images
- No content updates yet

**NOTES** : The website would call to the images from locations within MY PC. I have to figure out how to call the images from general locations. Website looks even more like garbage now.
